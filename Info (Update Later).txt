***ONLY USE WITH IVYBRIDGE CPUS***

Vast majority of all of this was made possible by https://github.com/linguine2552/ and his T420 coreboot repo (https://github.com/linguine2552/t420_coreboot_rom). The  .rom files in t420/ were all taken from his repo mentioned previously, as well as the ivy.config. When building this in the docker container put out by the coreboot team, I had no issues and was able to get things up and running right away with linquine2552’s config file for running IvyBridge CPUs on the T420.
